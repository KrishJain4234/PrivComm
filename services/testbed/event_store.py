Transient in-memory event store for live testbed execution events.

Events are NOT persisted to disk or Supabase  -  they exist only while
the process is running and are consumed by the frontend via polling.
Each job maintains a capped ring-buffer (max 200 events) so long-running
traffic profiles never cause unbounded memory growth.
